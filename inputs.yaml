# Training hyperparameters
n_epochs   : 200 # int: number of epochs
lr         : 0.01 # float: initial learning rate
device     : 'cuda' # str: which device to use 'cpu' or 'cuda:0'

# Scheduler options 
# The scheduler controls the learning rate during training, if it
# detects that the training loss is not changing for some period of time
# it will reduce the learning rate by some factor
factor    : 0.5 # float: learning rate multiplier
patience  : 5 # int: how many epochs to wait
threshold : 0.001 # float: if loss hasn't changed by more than this val.

# Seed for training, this option lets you control the seed from which to
# start the model each time, rather than letting the starting point be
# random each time, this can be used for testing the effect of different
# hyperparameters
use_seed : False # bool: option if we should use a seed or not
seed     : 0 # int: choose seed value

# Model choice, options:
# ['Linear', 'smallLinear', 'linRes', 'linResBN']
model : 'linRes' # str: model to use for training

# Loss function, options:
# ['BCELoss']
loss : 'BCELoss' # str: choose the loss function to use

# saving parameters
record_run : False # bool: do you want to record run to tensorboard?
save_model : False # bool: do you want to save model
dir_name   : 'models' # str: specify directory where to save models
