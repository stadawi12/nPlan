# TODO the data might not be balanced in which case we 
# cannot just choose the first 1000 examples, perhaps we should 
# take extra care here and balance the data first and load 
# only a portion of each class.
# Number of examples, set to null if want to load all
m_train : null # number of examples for training
m_test  : null # number of examples for testing

# Training hyperparameters
n_epochs : 1 # int: number of epochs

# Scheduler options 
# The scheduler controls the learning rate during training, if it
# detects that the training loss is not changing for some period of time
# it will reduce the learning rate by some factor
factor    : 0.5 # float: learning rate multiplier
patience  : 5 # int: how many epochs to wait
threshold : 0.001 # float: if loss hasn't changed by more than this val.

# Seed for training, this option lets you control the seed from which to
# start the model each time, rather than letting the starting point be
# random each time, this can be used for testing the effect of different
# hyperparameters
use_seed : True # bool: option if we should use a seed or not
seed     : 0 # int: choose seed value

# Model choice, options:
# ['Linear', 'smallLinear', 'normLinear', 'linRes']

# Loss function, options:
# ['BCELoss']
loss : 'BCELoss' # str: choose the loss function to use

# Do you want to record run to tensorboard?
