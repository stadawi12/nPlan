# TODO when choosing gpu as a device find out what happens with 
# validation and testing parts of training.
# Training inputs
n_epochs   : 50 # int: number of epochs
batch_size : 1000 # int: batch size
shuffle    : True # bool: Shuffle the data after each epoch
lr         : 0.01 # float: learning rate
device     : 'cpu' # str: which device to use

# Scheduler options 
# The scheduler controls the learning rate during training, if it
# detects that the training loss is not changing for some period of time
# it will reduce the learning rate by some factor
factor    : 0.5 # float: learning rate multiplier
patience  : 4 # int: how many epochs to wait
threshold : 0.001 # float: if loss hasn't changed by more than this value

# TODO this is not functional, make this functional
# Seed for training, this option lets you control the seed from which to
# start the model each time rather than letting the starting point be
# random each time, this can be used for testing the effect of different
# hyperparameters
use_seed : True # bool: option if we should use a seed or not
seed     : 0 # int: choose seed value

# Model choice, options:
# ['Linear', 'smallLinear']
model : 'smallLinear' # str: model to use for training

# Loss function, options:
# ['BCELoss']
loss : 'BCELoss' # str: choose the loss function to use
