# TODO when choosing gpu as a device find out what happens with 
# validation and testing parts of training.
# Training inputs
n_epochs   : 3 # int: number of epochs
batch_size : 1000 # int: batch size
shuffle    : True # bool: Shuffle the data after each epoch
lr         : 0.01 # float: learning rate
device     : 'cpu' # str: which device to use

# TODO make this functional
# Model choice, options:
# ['Linear']
model : 'Linear' # str: model to use for training

# Scheduler options 
# The scheduler controls the learning rate during training, if it
# detects that the training loss is not changing for some period of time
# it will reduce the learning rate by some factor
factor    : 0.5 # float: learning rate multiplier
patience  : 4 # int: how many epochs to wait
threshold : 0.001 # float: if loss hasn't changed by more than this value

# TODO make this functional
# Loss function
loss : 'BCELoss' # str: choose the loss function to use
